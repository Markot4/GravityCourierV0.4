# GravityCourierV0.4
This version has game over function. I implemented the sound that was supposed to count when you were close to failing, but it didn't activate.
As always. WASD for moving, shift for sprinting and ESC for pausing.
i forgot to mention the theme song was used from a build for Postal 3 mod Catharsis Reborn. So, Whackjob Entertainment, I apologize for using your theme song without permission.
